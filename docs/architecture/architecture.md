# WhatsApp Group Scraper - Modular Architecture

## Overview

The WhatsApp Group Scraper is built using a modular, dependency-injected architecture that promotes separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability. The system is designed to be extensible and scalable, with clear boundaries between different functional areas.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility. This makes the codebase easier to understand, test, and maintain.

### 2. **Dependency Injection**
All dependencies are injected rather than created directly, enabling easy testing and flexible configuration.

### 3. **Interface-Driven Design**
All modules communicate through well-defined interfaces, not concrete implementations. This allows for easy swapping of implementations.

### 4. **Layered Architecture**
The system follows a clear layered architecture:
- **Presentation Layer** (UI)
- **Application Layer** (Services)
- **Domain Layer** (Core Business Logic)
- **Infrastructure Layer** (External Dependencies)

### 5. **Event-Driven Communication**
Modules communicate through events when appropriate, reducing direct coupling.

- `IResourceMonitor` - System resource monitoring
- `IHealthMonitor` - Health checks
- `IAlertManager` - Alert management

**Features:**
- Real-time metrics
- Custom alerts
- Performance profiling
- Resource usage tracking

### 6. Security Module (`security/`)

Ensures application security at all levels.

**Interfaces:**
- `IAuthenticator` - Authentication services
- `IAuthorizer` - Authorization services
- `IRateLimiter` - Rate limiting
- `IValidator` - Input validation
- `IEncryption` - Encryption services
- `IAuditLogger` - Security audit logging

**Features:**
- JWT authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input sanitization
- Audit trail
- Rate limiting per user/IP

### 7. UI Module (`ui/`)

Modern, responsive user interface.

**Components:**
- `ModernUI.tsx` - Main UI component
- Theme system
- Responsive layouts
- Real-time updates

**Features:**
- Dark/Light theme support
- Responsive design
- Real-time data updates
- Export functionality

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Direct Dependency Injection
Services that need to communicate directly are wired through the DI container:

```typescript
class ScraperService {
  constructor(
    private extractors: IExtractorFactory,
    private storage: IStorageFactory,
    private monitor: IPerformanceMonitor
  ) {}
}
```

### 2. Event Bus
For loose coupling, services can communicate through events:

```typescript
eventBus.emit('message.extracted', { message, groupId });
eventBus.on('message.extracted', (data) => {
  // Handle event
});
```

### 3. Request/Response
Synchronous operations use direct method calls through interfaces:

```typescript
const messages = await messageStorage.getMessages(groupId, options);
```

## Data Flow

1. **User Initiates Extraction**
   - UI sends command to ScraperService
   - ScraperService validates request

2. **Browser Automation**
   - BrowserService launches browser
   - WhatsAppService handles login
   - Navigation to target groups

3. **Data Extraction**
   - Extractors parse DOM elements
   - Data is validated and transformed
   - Progress is reported to monitors

4. **Data Storage**
   - Storage services persist data
   - Cache is updated
   - Indexes are maintained

5. **Real-time Updates**
   - UI receives updates via events
   - Analytics are calculated
   - Alerts are triggered if needed

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User provides credentials
2. Authenticator validates credentials
3. JWT token is generated
4. Token is stored securely
5. All requests include token

### Authorization Flow
1. Token is validated
2. User permissions are loaded
3. Request is checked against permissions
4. Access is granted or denied
5. Audit log is updated

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- TLS for data in transit
- Input validation at all entry points
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Lazy Loading** - Services are loaded on demand
2. **Caching** - Frequently accessed data is cached
3. **Batch Operations** - Database operations are batched
4. **Connection Pooling** - Reuse database connections
5. **Async Operations** - Non-blocking I/O throughout

### Monitoring Metrics
- Response times
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization
- Database query performance
- Cache hit rates

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Hot module reloading
- Debug logging enabled
- Mock data support
- Browser automation in headed mode

### Production Environment
- Optimized builds
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Automated backups
- Horizontal scaling support

## Extension Points

### Adding New Extractors
1. Implement the appropriate interface (e.g., `IMessageExtractor`)
2. Register with the DI container
3. Update the factory if needed

### Adding New Storage Backends
1. Implement storage interfaces
2. Add configuration support
3. Register with the DI container

### Adding New Monitors
1. Implement monitor interface
2. Define metrics to collect
3. Configure alerts if needed

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual services in isolation
- Mock dependencies through DI
- Focus on business logic

### Integration Tests

- Use test database
- Verify data flow

### E2E Tests

## Best Practices

1. **Always use interfaces** - Never depend on concrete implementations
2. **Keep modules focused** - One responsibility per module
3. **Use proper lifecycles** - Singleton for stateless, Transient for stateful
4. **Handle errors gracefully** - All errors should be caught and logged
5. **Document interfaces** - Clear documentation for all public interfaces
6. **Version your APIs** - Maintain backward compatibility
7. **Monitor everything** - If it can fail, it should be monitored
